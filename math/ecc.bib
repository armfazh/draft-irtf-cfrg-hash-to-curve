@inproceedings{ft2012,
	abstract = "A number of recent works have considered the problem of constructing constant-time hash functions to various families of elliptic curves over finite fields. In the relevant literature, it has been occasionally asserted that constant-time hashing to certain special elliptic curves, in particular so-called BN elliptic curves, was an open problem. It turns out, however, that a suitably general encoding function was constructed by Shallue and van de Woestijne back in 2006.",
