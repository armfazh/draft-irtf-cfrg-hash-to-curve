--- abstract

This document specifies a number of algorithms that may be used to encode or hash an
arbitrary string to a point on an Elliptic Curve.

# Introduction {#introduction}

Many cryptographic protocols require a procedure which maps arbitrary input, e.g.,
passwords, to points on an elliptic curve (EC). Prominent examples include
Simple Password Exponential Key Exchange {{Jablon96}}, Password Authenticated
Key Exchange {{BMP00}}, Identity-Based Encryption {{BF01}} and
Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures {{BLS01}}.

Unfortunately for implementors, the precise mapping which is suitable for a
given scheme is not necessarily included in the description of the protocol.
Compounding this problem is the need to pick a suitable curve for the specific
protocol.

This document aims to address this lapse by providing a thorough set of
recommendations across a range of implementations, and curve types. We provide
implementation and performance details for each mechanism, along with references
to the security rationale behind each recommendation and guidance for
applications not yet covered.

Each algorithm conforms to a common interface, i.e., it maps a bitstring
{0, 1}^\* to a point on an elliptic curve E. For each variant, we describe the requirements for
E to make it work. Sample code for each variant is presented in the
appendix.  Unless otherwise stated, all elliptic curve points are assumed to be
represented as affine coordinates, i.e., (x, y) points on a curve.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.


# Background {#background}

Here we give a brief definition of elliptic curves, with an emphasis
on defining important parameters and their relation to encoding.

Let F be the finite field GF(p^k). We say that F is a field of characteristic
p. For most applications, F is a prime field, in which case k=1 and we will
simply write GF(p).

Elliptic curves can be represented by equations of different standard forms,
including, but not limited to: Weierstrass, Montgomery, and Edwards. Each
of these variants correspond to a different category of curve equation.
For example, the short Weierstrass equation is
`y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B`. Certain encoding functions may have requirements
on the curve form, the characteristic of the field, and the parameters, such as A and B in the previous example.

An elliptic curve E is specified by its equation, and a finite field F.
The curve E forms a group, whose elements correspond to those who satisfy the
curve equation, with values taken from the field F. As a group, E has order
n, which is the number of points on the curve. For security reasons, it is a
strong requirement that all cryptographic operations take place in a prime
order group. However, not all elliptic curves generate groups of prime order.
In those cases, it is allowed to work with elliptic curves of order n = qh,
where q is a large prime, and h is a short number known as the cofactor.
Thus, we may wish an encoding that returns points on the subgroup of order q.
Multiplying a point P on E by the cofactor h guarantees that hP is a point in
the subgroup of order q.

Summary of quantities:

| Symbol | Meaning | Relevance
|:------:|---------|----------
| p | Order of finite field, F = GF(p) | Curve points need to be represented in terms of p. For prime power extension fields, we write F = GF(p^k).
| n | Number of curve points, #E(F) = n |  For map to E, needs to produce n elements.
| q | Order of the largest prime subgroup of E, n = qh | If n is not prime, may need mapping to q.
| h | Cofactor | For mapping to subgroup, need to multiply by cofactor.

## Terminology {#terminology}

In the following, we categorize the terminology for mapping bitstrings to
points on elliptic curves.

### Encoding {#term-encoding}

In practice, the input of a given cryptographic algorithm will be a bitstring of
arbitrary length, denoted {0, 1}^\*. Hence, a concern for virtually all protocols
involving elliptic curves is how to convert this input into a curve point.
The general term "encoding" refers to the process of producing an
elliptic curve point given as input a bitstring. In some protocols, the original
message may also be recovered through a decoding procedure. An encoding may be deterministic
or probabilistic, although the latter is problematic in potentially leaking
plaintext information as a side-channel.

Suppose as the input to the encoding function we wish to use a fixed-length
bitstring of length L. Comparing sizes of the sets, 2^L and n,
an encoding function cannot be both deterministic and bijective.
We can instead use an injective encoding from {0, 1}^L to E, with
`L < log2(n)- 1`,  which is a bijection over a subset of points in E.
This ensures that encoded plaintext messages can be recovered.

In practice, encodings are commonly injective and invertible. Injective encodings map
inputs to a subset of points on the curve. Invertible encodings allow computation of
input bitstrings given a point on the curve.

### Serialization {#term-serialization}

A related issue is the conversion of an elliptic curve point to a bitstring. We
refer to this process as "serialization", since it is typically used for
compactly storing and transporting points, or for producing canonicalized
outputs. Since a deserialization algorithm can often be used as a type of
encoding algorithm, we also briefly document properties of these functions.

A straightforward serialization algorithm maps a point (x, y) on E to a bitstring of length
2\*log(p), given that x, y are both elements in GF(p). However, since
there are only n points in E (with n approximately equal to p), it is possible
to serialize to a bitstring of length log(n). For example, one common method
is to store the x-coordinate and a single bit to determine whether the point
is (x, y) or (x, -y), thus requiring log(p)+1 bits. This method reduces storage,
but adds computation, since the deserialization process must recover the y
coordinate.

### Random Oracle {#term-rom}

It is often the case that the output of the encoding function {{term-encoding}}
should be (a) distributed uniformly at random on the elliptic curve and (b) non-invertible.
That is, there is no discernible relation existing between outputs that can be computed
based on the inputs. Moreover, given such an encoding function F from bitstrings to
points on the curve, as well as a single point y, it is computationally intractable to
produce an input x that maps to a y via F. In practice, these requirement stem from needing
a random oracle which outputs elliptic curve points:  one way to construct this is by first
taking a regular random oracle, operating entirely on bitstrings, and applying a
suitable encoding function to the output.

This motivates the term "hashing to the curve", since cryptographic hash
functions are typically modeled as random oracles. However, this still leaves open
the question of what constitutes a suitable encoding method, which is a primary
concern of this document.

A random oracle onto an elliptic curve can also be instantiated using
direct constructions, however these tend to rely on many group operations
and are less efficient than hash and encode methods.


# Algorithm Recommendations {#recommendations}

In practice, two types of mappings are common: (1) Injective encodings, as can be used to
construct a PRF as F(k, m) = k\*H(m), and (2) Random Oracles, as required by PAKEs {{BMP00}},
BLS {{BLS01}}, and IBE {{BF01}}. (Some applications, such as IBE, have additional requirements,
such as a Supersingular, pairing-friendly curve.)

The following table lists recommended algorithms for different curves and mappings. To select
a suitable algorithm, choose the mapping associated with the target curve. For example,
Elligator2 is the recommended injective encoding function for Curve25519, whereas Simple SWU
is the recommended injective encoding for P-256. Similarly, the FFSTV Random Oracle construction
described in {{ffstv}} composed with Elligator2 should be used for Random Oracle mappings
to Curve25519. When the required mapping is not clear, applications SHOULD use a Random Oracle.

| Curve  | Inj. Encoding | Random Oracle |
|--------|---------------|------|
| P-256 | Simple SWU {{simple-swu}} | FFSTV(SWU) {{ffstv}}
| P-384 | Icart {{icart}} | FFSTV(Icart) {{ffstv}}
| Curve25519 | Elligator2 {{elligator2}} | FFSTV(Elligator2) {{ffstv}}
| Curve448 | Elligator2 {{elligator2}} | FFSTV(Elligator2) {{ffstv}}

# Utility Functions {#utility}

Algorithms in this document make use of utility functions described below.

- HashToBase(x, i).
  This method is parametrized by p and H, where p is the prime order of
  the base field Fp, and H is a cryptographic hash function which
  outputs at least floor(log2(p)) + 2 bits.
  The function first hashes x, converts the result to an integer,
  and reduces modulo p to give an element of Fp.

  We provide a more detailed algorithm in {{hashtobase}}. The value of i is used
  to separate inputs when used multiple times in one algorithm (see {{ffstv}}
  for example). When i is omitted, we set it to 0.

- CMOV(a, b, c): If c = 1, return a, else return b.

  Common software implementations of constant-time selects assume c = 1 or c = 0. CMOV
  may be implemented by computing the desired selector (0 or 1) by ORing all bits of c
  together. The end result will be either 0 if all bits of c are zero, or 1 if at least
  one bit of c is 1.

- CTEQ(a, b): Returns a == b.
  Inputs a and b must be the same length (as bytestrings) and the comparison
  must be implemented in constant time.

- Legendre(x, p): x^((p-1)/2).
  The Legendre symbol computes whether the value x is a "quadratic
  residue" modulo p, and takes values 1, -1, 0, for when x is a residue,
  non-residue, or zero, respectively. Due to Euler's criterion, this can be
  computed in constant time, with respect to a fixed p, using
  the equation x^((p-1)/2). For clarity, we will generally prefer using the
  formula directly, and annotate the usage with this definition.

- sqrt(x, p):
  Computing square roots should be done in constant time where possible.

  When p = 3 (mod 4), the square root can be computed as `sqrt(x, p) := x^(p+1)/4`.
  This applies to P256, P384, and Curve448.

  When p = 5 (mod 8), the square root can be computed by the following
  algorithm, in which `sqrt(-1)` is a field element and can be precomputed.
  This applies to Curve25519.

~~~
  sqrt(x, p) :=
                 x^(p+3)/8     if x^(p+3)/4 == x
      sqrt(-1) * x^(p+3)/8     otherwise
~~~

  The above two conditions hold for most practically used curves, due to the
  simplicity of the square root function. For others, a suitable constant-time
  Tonelli-Shanks variant should be used as in {{Schoof85}}.

# Deterministic Encodings

## Interface

The generic interface for deterministic encoding functions to elliptic curves is as follows:

~~~
map2curve(alpha)
~~~

where alpha is a message to encode on a curve.

## Notation

As a rough style guide for the following, we use (x, y) to be the output
coordinates of the encoding method. Indexed values are used when the algorithm
will choose between candidate values. For example, the SWU algorithm computes
three candidates (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), from which the final (x, y)
output is chosen via constant time comparison operations.

We use u, v to denote the values in Fp output from HashToBase, and use as
initial values in the encoding.

We use t1, t2, ..., as reusable temporary variables. For notable variables, we
will use a distinct name, for ease of debugging purposes when correlating with
test vectors.

The code presented here corresponds to the example Sage {{SAGE}} code found at
{{github-repo}}. Which is additionally used to generate intermediate test
vectors. The Sage code is also checked against the hacspec implementation.

Note that each encoding requires that certain preconditions must hold in
order to be applied.

## Encodings for Weierstrass curves

The following encodings apply to elliptic curves defined as E: y^2 = x^3+Ax+B,
where 4A^3+27B^2 ≠ 0.

15. t1 = u2 * c2             // u^2 / 3
16.  x = x + t1              // (v^2 - B - u^6/27) ^ (1/3) + (u^2 / 3)

5. x2 = (-B / A)(1 + 1 / (u^4 * g(v)^2 + u^2 * g(v)))
6. x3 = u^2 * g(v)^2  * g(x2)
7. If g(x1) is square, output (x1, sqrt(g(x1)))
8. If g(x2) is square, output (x2, sqrt(g(x2)))
9. Output (x3, sqrt(g(x3)))
~~~

The algorithm relies on the following equality:

~~~
u^3 * g(v)^2  * g(x2) = g(x1) * g(x2) * g(x3)

The algorithm computes three candidate points, constructed such that at least one of
them lies on the curve.

## Encodings for Montgomery curves

A Montgomery curve is given by the following equation E: By^2=x^3+Ax^2+x, where
B(A^2 − 4) ≠ 0. Note that any curve with a point of order 2 is isomorphic to
this representation. Also notice that E cannot have a prime order group, hence,
a scalar multiplication by the cofactor h={4,8} is required to obtain a point
in the main subgroup.

19.  y = y * x
20.  y = y + B
21.  y = y * x
22.  y = sqrt(y)          // TODO: Specify square root properly
23.  y = y * ne            // y = -e * sqrt(x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx)
24.  x = CMOV(0, x, 1-u)

# Random Oracles

## Interface

The generic interface for deterministic encoding functions to elliptic curves is as follows:

~~~
hash2curve(alpha)
~~~

where alpha is a message to encode on a curve.

## General Construction (FFSTV13) {#ffstv}

When applications need a Random Oracle (RO), they can be constructed from deterministic encoding
functions. In particular, let F : {0,1}^* -> E be a deterministic encoding function onto
curve E, and let H0 and H1 be two hash functions modeled as random oracles that map input
messages to the base field of E, i.e., Z_q. Farashahi et al. {{FFSTV13}} showed that the
following mapping is indistinguishable from a RO:

~~~
hash2curve(alpha) = F(H0(alpha)) + F(H1(alpha))
~~~

This construction works for the Icart, SWU, and Simplfied SWU encodings.

Here, H0 and H1 are constructed as follows:

~~~
H0(alpha) = HashToBase(alpha, 2)
H1(alpha) = HashToBase(alpha, 3)
~~~

# Curve Transformations

Every elliptic curve can be converted to an equivalent curve in short Weierstrass form
({{BL07}} Theorem 2.1), making SWU a generic algorithm that can be used for all curves.
Curves in either Edwards or Twisted Edwards form can be transformed into equivalent
curves in Montgomery form {{BL17}} for use with Elligator2.
{{RFC7748}} describes how to convert between points on Curve25519 and Ed25519,
and between Curve448 and its Edwards equivalent, Goldilocks.

# Ciphersuites

To provide concrete recommendations for algorithms we define a hash-to-curve
"ciphersuite" as a four-tuple containing:

* HashToBase algorithm

* (Optional) Transformation (e.g. FFSTV, cofactor clearing)

A ciphersuite defines an algorithm that takes an arbitrary octet string and

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# Security Considerations

Each encoding function variant accepts arbitrary input and maps it to a pseudorandom
point on the curve. Points are close to indistinguishable from randomly chosen
elements on the curve. Not all encoding functions are full-domain hashes. Elligator2,
for example, only maps strings to "about half of all curve points," whereas Icart's
method only covers about 5/8 of the points.

# Related Work {#related}

In this chapter, we  give a background to some common methods to encode or
hash to the curve, motivated by the similar exposition in {{Icart09}}.
Understanding of this material is not required in order to choose a
suitable encoding function - we defer this to {{recommendations}}
 - the background covered here can work as a template for analyzing encoding
functions not found in this document, and as a guide for further research
into the topics covered.

## Probabilistic Encoding

As mentioned in {{background}}, as a rule of thumb, for every x in GF(p), there
is approximately a 1/2 chance that there exist a corresponding y value such that
(x, y) is on the curve E.

This motivates the construction of the MapToGroup
method described by Boneh et al. {{BLS01}}. For an input message m, a counter i,
and a standard hash function H : {0, 1}^* -> GF(p) x {0, 1}, one computes (x, b)
= H(i || m), where i || m denotes concatenation of the two values. Next, test to
see whether there exists a corresponding y value such that (x, y) is on the
curve, returning (x, y) if successful, where b determines whether to take +/- y.
If there does not exist such a y, then increment i and repeat. A maximum counter
value is set to I, and since each iteration succeeds with probability
approximately 1/2, this process fails with probability 2^-I. (See {{try}} for a
more detailed description of this algorithm.)

Although MapToGroup describes a method to hash to the curve, it can also be
adapted to a simple encoding mechanism. For a bitstring of length strictly
less than log2(p), one can make use of the spare bits in order to encode
the counter value. Allocating more space for the counter increases the expansion,
but reduces the failure probability.

Since the running time of the MapToGroup algorithm depends on m,
this algorithm is NOT safe for cases sensitive to timing side channel attacks.
Deterministic algorithms are needed in such cases where failures
are undesirable.

## Naive Encoding

A naive solution includes computing H(m)\*G as map2curve(m), where H is a standard hash
function H : {0, 1}^* -> GF(p), and G is a generator of the curve. Although
efficient, this solution is unsuitable for constructing a random oracle onto
E, since the discrete logarithm with respect to G is known. For example,
given y1 = map2curve(m1) and y2 = map2curve(m2) for any m1 and m2, it must
be true that y2 = H(m2) / H(m1) * map2curve(m1). This relationship would not
hold (with overwhelming probability) for truly random values y1 and y2.
This causes catastrophic failure in many cases. However, one exception is found in
SPEKE {{Jablon96}}, which constructs a base for a Diffie-Hellman key exchange by
hashing the password to a curve point. Notably the use of a hash function is
purely for encoding an arbitrary length string to a curve point, and does not
need to be a random oracle.

## Deterministic Encoding

Shallue, Woestijne, and Ulas {{SW06}} first introduced a deterministic
algorithm that maps elements in F_{q} to a curve in time O(log^4 q), where q = p^n for
some prime p, and time O(log^3 q) when q = 3 mod 4. Icart introduced yet another
deterministic algorithm which maps F_{q} to any EC where q = 2 mod 3 in time O(log^3 q) {{Icart09}}.
Elligator (2) {{Elligator2}} is yet another deterministic algorithm for any odd-characteristic
EC that has a point of order 2. Elligator2 can be applied to Curve25519 and Curve448, which
are both CFRG-recommended curves {{RFC7748}}.

However, an important caveat to all of the above deterministic encoding functions,
is that none of them map injectively to the entire curve, but rather
some fraction of the points. This makes them unable to use to directly
construct a random oracle on the curve.

Brier et al. {{SimpleSWU}} proposed a couple of solutions to this problem, The
first applies solely to Icart's method described above, by computing F(H0(m))
+ F(H1(m)) for two distinct hash functions H0, H1. The second uses a generator
G, and computes F(H0(m)) + H1(m)\*G. Later, Farashahi et al. {{FFSTV13}}
showed the generality of the F(H0(m)) + F(H1(m)) method, as well as the
applicability to hyperelliptic curves (not covered here).

## Supersingular Curves

For supersingular curves, for every y in GF(p) (with p>3), there exists a value
x such that (x, y) is on the curve E. Hence we can construct a bijection
F : GF(p) -> E (ignoring the point at infinity). This is the case for
{{BF01}}, but is not common.

## Twisted Variants

We can also consider curves which have twisted variants, E^d. For such curves,
for any x in GF(p), there exists y in GF(p) such that (x, y) is either a point
on E or E^d. Hence one can construct a bijection F : GF(p) x {0,1} -> E ∪ E^d,
where the extra bit is needed to choose the sign of the point. This can be
particularly useful for constructions which only need the x-coordinate of the
point. For example, x-only scalar multiplication can be computed on Montgomery
curves. In this case, there is no need for an encoding function, since the output
of F in GF(p) is sufficient to define a point on one of E or E^d.

# Try-and-Increment Method {#try}

In cases where constant time execution is not required, the so-called
try-and-increment method may be appropriate. As discussion in {{introduction}},
this variant works by hashing input m using a standard hash function ("Hash"), e.g., SHA256, and
then checking to see if the resulting point (m, f(m)), for curve function f, belongs on E.
This is detailed below.

~~~
1. ctr = 0
2. h = "INVALID"
3. While h is "INVALID" or h is EC point at infinity:
4.1   CTR = I2OSP(ctr, 4)
4.2   ctr = ctr + 1
4.3   attempted_hash = Hash(m || CTR)
4.4   h = RS2ECP(attempted_hash)
4.5   If h is not "INVALID" and cofactor > 1, set h = h * cofactor
5. Output h
~~~

I2OSP is a function that converts a nonnegative integer to octet string as
defined in Section 4.1 of {{RFC8017}}, and RS2ECP(h) = OS2ECP(0x02 || h), where
OS2ECP is specified in Section 2.3.4 of {{SECG1}}, which converts an input
string into an EC point.

## HashToBase {#hashtobase}

The following procedure implements HashToBase.

~~~
HashToBase(x, i)

Parameters:

  H - cryptographic hash function to use
  hbits - number of bits output by H
  p - order of the base field Fp
  label - context label for domain separation

Preconditions:

  floor(log2(p)) + 1 >= hbits

Input:

  x - value to be hashed, an octet string
  i - hash call index, a non-negative integer

Output:

  y - a value in the field Fp

Steps:

  1. t1 = H("h2c" || label || I2OSP(i, 4) || I2OSP(len(x), 4) || x)
  2. t2 = OS2IP(t1)
  3. y = t2 (mod p)
  4. Output y
~~~

where I2OSP, OS2IP {{RFC8017}} are used to convert an octet string to and from
a non-negative integer, and a || b denotes concatenation of a and b.

### Considerations

Performance: HashToBase requires hashing the entire input x. In some
algorithms/ciphersuite combinations, HashToBase is called multiple times. For
large inputs, implementers can therefore consider hashing x before calling
HashToBase. I.e. HashToBase(H'(x)).

Most algorithms assume that HashToBase maps its input to the base field
uniformly. In practice, there will be inherent biases. For example, taking H
as SHA256, over the finite field used by Curve25519 we have p = 2^255 - 19, and
thus when reducing from 255 bits, the values of 0 .. 19 will be twice as
likely to occur. This is a standard problem in generating uniformly
distributed integers from a bitstring. In this example, the resulting bias is
negligible, but for others this bias can be significant.

To address this, our HashToBase algorithm greedily takes as many bits as
possible before reducing mod p, in order to smooth out this bias. This is
preferable to an iterated procedure, such as rejection sampling, since this
can be hard to reliably implement in constant time.

The running time of each map2curve function is dominated by the cost of
finite field inversion. Assuming T_i(F) is the time of inversion in field F,
a rough bound on the running time of each map2curve function is O(T_i(F))
for the associated field.
