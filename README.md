## Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md).

### Reference Implementations

The purpose of these implementations is for generating test vectors and enabling cross compatibility with other implementations.

Note that these implementations cannot be used in production systems because side-channel countermeasures are not included.
